<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sizzling sisig is a Kapampangan delicacy usually served as an appetizer but has evolved over the years into a popular
    dinner entree.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds pig face (snouts, ears, and jowls)</li>
    <li>1 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 head garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon whole peppercorns</li>
    <li>>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>1 large onion, peeled and diced</li>
    <li>6 Thai chili peppers, stemmed and minced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup calamansi juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Liquid seasoning (I used Maggi)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup liver spread</li>
    <li>pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot, combine pig face, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, about 1 tablespoon salt,
        and enough water to completely cover pork. </li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 50 minutes to 1 hour
        or until meat is tender. Remove from heat and drain well, discarding liquid.</li>
    <li>Over a hot grill, grill pork for about 7 to 10 minutes on each side or until crisp and slightly charred. Or
        arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil in a 450 F oven for about 4 to 5 minutes or until nicely
        charred.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, allow to cool to touch, and chop meat.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine chopped meat, onions, chili peppers, calamansi juice., and liquid seasoning. </li>
    <li>And liver spread and gently stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>To serve, transfer to sizzling hot plates.</li>
